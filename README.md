# Global terrorism database visualization
This repository holds the semester project for the [Data Visualization](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/107652/Data-Visualization) at Aarhus University, 2021.

## Goal
Make an interactive visualization of the dataset.

## Tools
- Database: [Global Terrorism Database](https://start.umd.edu/gtd/) maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.
- [Python Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction)

## To start 
1. Download dataset from https://start.umd.edu/gtd/. You need to create an individual account.  
Alternatively, download dataset from the link I provided you (in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Global-terrorism-database-visualization-c2c02ba71f414701a77fc86f19ef1ce8)).
2. Save the dataset in `/project_directory/dataset/`.
3. Create an empty file called `.mapbox_token` and add your public mapbox token there.
4. Activate whatever python environment you're using.
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Run `jupyter lab`.
7. Explore the data.
